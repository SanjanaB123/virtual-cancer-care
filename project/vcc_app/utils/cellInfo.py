        <br/> Please consider the following suggestions:

        <br/><br/> 1. <i> Manure </i> – adding manure is one of the simplest ways to amend your soil with nitrogen. Be careful as there are various types of manures with varying degrees of nitrogen.

        <br/> 2. <i>Coffee grinds </i> – use your morning addiction to feed your gardening habit! Coffee grinds are considered a green compost material which is rich in nitrogen. Once the grounds break down, your soil will be fed with delicious, delicious nitrogen. An added benefit to including coffee grounds to your soil is while it will compost, it will also help provide increased drainage to your soil.

        <br/>4. Plant ‘green manure’ crops like cabbage, corn and brocolli
